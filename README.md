## Week 1
12/09/2016
I need to remember to write a reflective report. 
This week was comprised of events which I did not attend, aside from the last part of the week where the induction session took place, due to this I don’t have much to report about it.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
This week was a week which sparked major anxiety in me since I had to move away from home and stay at school which is the place I’ve been trying to avoid my whole life.
I had a few struggles, but time was the only thing needed to make it through the week and help me feel more comfortable at university.
The lego robot exercise was very useful in helping me find people who I could communicate with in the group. 
Unfortunately I went home on Thursday, this was partly due solely to being exhausted from the social aspect of University.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
I only made it to half of the timetabled lessons this week but this was due to being physically ill and not being able to attend, as such not much happened this week.

I need to remember to write a reflective report. This week seemed to be going well however during my lunch break on Tuesday I had a major anxiety attack out of nowhere which resulted in me going to see the support team on campus and eventually agreeing that I would go home for the rest of the week.
Even though they told me to go back to my flat and wait for my parents to come and pick me up I did end up going back to the lecture that I had that afternoon, partly because I didn’t wish for people to think I was lazy but mainly because I genuinely enjoy this course.
This Tuesday was the day which introduced the Agile learning philosophy which meant that I missed out on half the explanation of it and did not fully understand it at the end, 
normally I would have asked someone to go over it again but that day I felt rude doing so since I came in late to the session.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
The first week where I actually attended everything that was timetabled (better late than never) which came at the cost of a long weekend of anxiety attacks springing up over and over again and only barely recovering to go back to university next week.
Due to the stress of coming home I came to the conclusion that, although I would not enjoy it at first, the best long term plan would be to move into University 24/7.

The monday lecture with Ed introduced complexity in computation which as the name suggests was complex and confusing, by the end I was still confused about the subject as a whole but I did not ask him to clarify because he said at this point he expected everyone to be confused.
Tuesday was the day which we pitched our game concept ideas which we had been working on since last tuesday to the class, as one could imagine this terrified me but the presentation seemed to go well despite my concept not being green-lit

# Term 2
23/01/2017
I missed the first lecture from Ed this week because I couldn't get back to the university in time. Worksheet A was due in on the first day as well which I found challenging and interesting, it certainly was more interesting than the worksheets from the previous term. Aside from that it was a pretty empty week... Not much to really say for this week.

Compared to the first term I seem to be a lot better in regards to managing my anxiety and workflow, with the exception of our work with the BA group on the game. Every week we meet and plan what we are going to do and what we didn't do last week, like a stand-up meeting gone wrong, instead of talking about what we did and what we plan to do. We instead talk about what we didn't do and what we will do over the next week (but usually end up not doing due to lack of motivation or skill).
Half of the programmers also rarely turn up and nothing seems to be being done about that. 
I understand that at this level of education the general idea is to self-educate to an extent but if this is the case and you wish us to teach ourselves about C++ and the unreal engine to be used in production with the game then the game will not be satisfactory in terms of quality, unless you had previous experience in this field.

06/02/2017
Worksheet B deadline at the start of this week and I struggled a lot with this one, I asked Ed for help to which he did of course say he would, but I wanted to be safe and receive help before the deadline so I would have something to show if all goes wrong. This meant that I didn't really understand how to make a mandelbrot set. Ed did go through it on Monday but it didn't work, which was ironic, I haven't lost much sleep over the fact that I don't know how to make a mandelbrot set since I doubt I'll ever need to make one again.

13/02/2017
Both myself and my BA group are wondering if there is much point in going to the supervised studio practises on Thursday as the room is always full, sometimes with people that aren't timetabled to be there, the noise is at a volume which prevents anyone from listening to Brian (even though he's Scottish and should be heard from the other side of the solar system). This week we decided to leave almost as soon as we arrived as there were no spaces to sit and we agreed that we would get more work done at home, due to this I have never actually been to one of these sessions and stayed till the end.
