I need to remember to write a reflective report. 
This week was comprised of events which I did not attend, aside from the last part of the week where the induction session took place, due to this I don’t have much to report about it.

This week was a week which sparked major anxiety in me since I had to move away from home and stay at school which is the place I’ve been trying to avoid my whole life.
I had a few struggles, but time was the only thing needed to make it through the week and help me feel more comfortable at university. The lego robot exercise was very useful in helping me find people who I could communicate with in the group. Unfortunately I went home on Thursday due to being too tired to carry on, mentally.

I only made it to half of the timetabled lessons this week but this was due to being physically ill and not being able to attend, as such not much happened this week.

I need to remember to write a reflective report. This week seemed to be going well however during my lunch break on Tuesday I had a major anxiety attack out of nowhere which resulted in me going to see the support team on campus and eventually agreeing that I would go home for the rest of the week. Even though they told me to go back to my flat and wait for my parents to come and pick me up I did end up going back to the lecture that I had that afternoon, partly because I didn’t wish for people to think I was lazy but mainly because I genuinely enjoy this course.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
The first week where I actually attended everything that was timetabled (better late than never) which came at the cost of a long weekend of anxiety attacks springing up over and over again and only barely recovering to go back to university next week. Due to the stress of coming home I came to the conclusion that, although I would not enjoy it at first, the best long term plan would be to move into University 24/7.
