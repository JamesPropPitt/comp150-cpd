## Week 1
```12/09/2016
I need to remember to write a reflective report. 
This week was comprised of events which I did not attend, aside from the last part of the week where the induction session took place, due to this I don’t have much to report about it.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
This week was a week which sparked major anxiety in me since I had to move away from home and stay at school which is the place I’ve been trying to avoid my whole life.
I had a few struggles, but time was the only thing needed to make it through the week and help me feel more comfortable at university.
The lego robot exercise was very useful in helping me find people who I could communicate with in the group. 
Unfortunately I went home on Thursday, this was partly due solely to being exhausted from the social aspect of University.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
I only made it to half of the timetabled lessons this week but this was due to being physically ill and not being able to attend, as such not much happened this week.

I need to remember to write a reflective report. This week seemed to be going well however during my lunch break on Tuesday I had a major anxiety attack out of nowhere which resulted in me going to see the support team on campus and eventually agreeing that I would go home for the rest of the week.
Even though they told me to go back to my flat and wait for my parents to come and pick me up I did end up going back to the lecture that I had that afternoon, partly because I didn’t wish for people to think I was lazy but mainly because I genuinely enjoy this course.
This Tuesday was the day which introduced the Agile learning philosophy which meant that I missed out on half the explanation of it and did not fully understand it at the end, normally I would have asked someone to go over it again but that day I felt rude doing so since I came in late to the session.

I need to remember to write a reflective report.
The first week where I actually attended everything that was timetabled (better late than never) which came at the cost of a long weekend of anxiety attacks springing up over and over again and only barely recovering to go back to university next week.
Due to the stress of coming home I came to the conclusion that, although I would not enjoy it at first, the best long term plan would be to move into University 24/7.

The monday lecture with Ed introduced complexity in computation which as the name suggests was complex and confusing, by the end I was still confused about the subject as a whole but I did not ask him to clarify because he said at this point he expected everyone to be confused.
Tuesday was the day which we pitched our game concept ideas which we had been working on since last tuesday to the class, as one could imagine this terrified me but the presentation seemed to go well despite my concept not being green-lit.```
