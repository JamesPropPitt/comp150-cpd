# 5 skills I need to improve on.

## Coding
This term I only worked on projects which used blueprints, this meant I hardly did any actual coding practise with any programming language aside
from a minor amount of C++ when the blueprints were acting up. My lack of knowledge when it comes to actual coding creates problems with 
creating and writing programs as well as creating and comprehending blueprints. 
Over summer I intend to work on an independent project which involves C++ coding, this will help my further my abilties in programming
languages as once I have a firm understanding of one it should be easier to understand others. The obvious time frame for this the length of the summer
holidays, and the measurable aspect of this goal is the quality of the game I produce over summer. 

## Speaking
I don't feel as though I'm a very interesting person so when people are paying attention to me, I experience performance anxiety, 
unfortunately this usually results in me producing gibberish, putting words in an incomprehensible order
or simply forgetting a great majority of my vocabulary. I think this stems from self confidence issues which I can't see improving any time soon
therefore, a way of resolving this issue that I have come up with, is to practise talking to people and expose myself to that type of 
situation.
I have never had a job before in my life and I plan to get one over the summer holidays which should help build my confidence and since
I will need to speak to people, in a manner which efficiently conveys appropriate and relevant information,
it will be good practise for me. This is relevant not only just because communication
is somewhat of a necessity in life but specifically my field of study demands that I communicate with members of a team so I need to be
able to convey useful information and not just jargon. I hope that, in 10 weeks time, these situations will feel more natural and I will
be able to relay information without worrying about adding any personal context. 

## GCSE Maths
During the summer holidays I intend to refresh my mathematical abilities to get them back up to at least a GCSE level, due to the nature of my course
maths is a recurring theme which needs to be addressed. My plan for this is to visit websites such as GCSE Bitesize and work on the exercises they have available
on the website and the tests, which are a great way to measure my progress. 

## Group work
I have found group work somewhat challenging this semester as we have been working with the BA course and they have a different approach
to projects and at times I have found them quite difficult to work with in a team. However as we are to be working with them for the
rest of my course I need to be able to develop effective ways of working with them.
To measure this I intend to make a list based on analysing how they behave and how they react to certain situations, such as when situations
go wrong and situations go well. This is helpful as it will inform me on how to interact with artists and/or people from that professional
background as the field I intend to go into will be working with them every day.

## Reading
Sometimes I will spend hours staring at one page, reading it over and over, but not actually take in any information from the text. This is
is the case with non-fiction and fiction bodies of text, the content is irrelevant. This leads to a lack of comprehension even after reading
an article in a thorough fashion, which creates problems when asked to write an essay based on research articles which I should have read.
Over the course of the rest of this term I hope to improve my reading ability by forcing myself to read more and more, practising different reading techniques,
and wearing my glasses more often. To test myself I will then write a summary of all the articles and/or books I have read and synthesise them 
into a, hopefully, simple body of text. Also this is something I will be working on in study skills session with my study skills tutor, Charlotte.
